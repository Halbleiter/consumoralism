# consumoralism
The goal of this project is to develope an App which allows the user to search and filter products of interest using ethical criteria. 
Ideally, the App should support the user by making purchase descions which are in agreement with his or her moral belief system. 
The evalution system used by the filter must of course only refelct to some degree the subjective moral system of the developer and does not claim universality.       
      
The filter should be focused on products which are bought on a daily bases. It should allow the user to make weighted priorisations, like e.g. 
  
  - enviromental impact 
  - social impact
  - producing companies 
  
  The latter could help the user to detect subbrachnig of big companies
