# consumoralism
The goal of this project is to develope an App which allows the user to search and filter products of interest using ethical criteria. 
Ideally, the App should support the user to make purchase descions which are compatible with his or her moral belief system. 
The evalution system used by the filter can of course only refelct the subjective moral believes of the developer and does not 
claim universality.       
      
The filter should be focused on products which are bought on daily bases. It should offer different priorisations, like e.g. 
  
  - enviromental impact of the products
  - social impact
  - producing companies (help the user to detect subbrachnig of big companies)
