# consumoralism
The goal of this project is to develope an App which allows the user to search and filter products of interest using ethical criteria. 
Ideally, the App should support the user to make purchase descions which are in agreement with his or her moral belief system. 
The moral evalution system implemented can of course only be a refelction of the subjective belief systems of the indivdiual developers, and thus has no claim of universality.       
      
The filter should be focused on products which are bought on a daily bases. It should allow the user to make weighted priorisations, like e.g. 
  
  - enviromental impact 
  - social impact
  - producing companies (detect subbrachnig of big companies)
